Metamaps
=======

Welcome to the Metamaps GitHub repo. 

## About

Metamaps is a free and AGPL open source technology for changemakers, innovators, educators and students. It enables individuals and communities to build and visualize their shared knowledge and unlock their collective intelligence. You can find out about more about the project at the [blog][site-blog].

You can find a version of this software running at [metamaps.cc][site-beta], where the technology is being tested in a private beta.

Metamaps is created and maintained by a distributed, nomadic community comprised of technologists, artists and storytellers. You can get in touch with us at team@metamaps.cc or @metamapps on twitter. 

To get connected with the community interested in Metamaps, join our [Google+ community][community].

## Installation

Depending on which OS you are using, the instructions for getting set up with a local installation of the Metamaps software will vary. Because the software has both Node.js components, and RubyOnRails, getting set up with your local copy can take 1 to 2 hours.
